# Student Performance Prediction 📊

A simple **Machine Learning** project in Python that predicts a student’s final grade based on study hours, attendance, and past performance using **Linear Regression** (scikit-learn). This project demonstrates loading data, training a model, evaluating it, and making predictions.

## 📌 Features

- Uses **pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling  
- Splits data into training and test sets  
- Trains a **Linear Regression** model (scikit-learn)  
- Evaluates performance with **MSE** and **R²**  
- Provides an example prediction for a new student

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load or define the dataset  
2. Prepare features (`Hours_Studied`, `Attendance`, `Past_Performance`) and target (`Final_Grade`)  
3. Train a regression model  
4. Evaluate it with test data  
5. Predict the final grade for new inputs
